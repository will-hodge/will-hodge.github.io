summary: Project that takes your facial expression, processes the emotion, and then searches for a song on Spotify that matches that emotion.

For my final project in my Graphical User Interfaces class I was instructed to make an app that utilizes a non-traditional form of human-computer interaction. I used the Affectiva and Spotify Web APIs to create a web application that uses a computer webcam to analyze the emotion of the user and then delivers a song from Spotify that matches their emotion.

Written mainly in client-side JavaScript.
