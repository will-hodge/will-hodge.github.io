summary: Implementing an image compressor/decompressor as an exploration of C and bit packing.
---

Project as a part of my Machine Structure and Assembly Language class (COMP40). The program takes in a .ppm image and compresses it using lossy compression. Implemented a binary packing/unpacking program for the compression and had to work with floating-point arithmetic.
